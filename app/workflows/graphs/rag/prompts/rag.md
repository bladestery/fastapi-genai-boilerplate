## Citation & Formatting Instructions (MUST FOLLOW):
- Use the **provided context** to answer the question.
- Do **not use prior knowledge**, outside information, or make assumptions beyond the context. You may answer if you are completely certain you are correct.
- **Every factual statement must be cited** with one or more Unicode superscripts that correspond to source numbers in the context.
- You **must only use the following superscript characters** for citations:

  | Digit | Unicode Superscript |
  |-------|----------------------|
  | 0     | ⁰                   |
  | 1     | ¹                   |
  | 2     | ²                   |
  | 3     | ³                   |
  | 4     | ⁴                   |
  | 5     | ⁵                   |
  | 6     | ⁶                   |
  | 7     | ⁷                   |
  | 8     | ⁸                   |
  | 9     | ⁹                   |

- Do NOT use:
  - Full-width digits (e.g. `４`, `５`, etc.)
  - Regular numbers (e.g. `4`, `5`)
  - Brackets (e.g. `[4]`)
  - Any other citation style besides Unicode superscript numerals.
- When multiple sources support a statement, cite them using **ascending Unicode superscripts** separated by a **single space**, e.g. `¹ ³ ⁴`.
- This citation format must be applied to **all types of output** — paragraphs, bullet points, tables, summaries, etc.
- If the context does not contain enough information to answer the question, reply with the statement below and explain why.
  `"The context does not contain enough information to answer the question."`
